# Task List
Let's build a Task List in Rails! We will solve the problem of tracking tasks in a web application. This project will enable us to keep track of and persist, add, edit and remove tasks.

## Learning Goals
Practice all aspects of Rails development.
- Create a new Rails application
- Explore each aspect of the Rails Request Cycle: Model, View, Controller
- Implement RESTful routes using Rails standards

## Baseline
Once you've achieved this baseline, see if you can answer questions or help other folks.

This is an individual Stage 1 project.

### Setup

- Fork and clone this repository to your computer
- Create a new Rails 5 application
  - create a controller for your `Tasks`
  - create a `Task` model (via a migration)
    - create the database schema and tables with `rake db:migrate`
    - the `Task` model should include _at least_ a name, a description and a completion date
  - conform to Rails conventions on naming and inflection

Tinker with your Model in the `rails console` in order to ensure you have created your model and can interact with it as expected.

## Wave 1
This wave is where we will introduce the view layer to interact with our application via the browser.

<!-- - Use the provided seed data to pre-populate your database with a given set of tasks.
  - Hint: research `rake db:seed` -->
- Set up necessary controller(s) and route(s) that you will need in order to show a task from the database
- Create a **root route** for your application that directs users to the list of tasks
  - Each task name in the list should link to a `show` action that will render a new view for the user
  - The `show` view should include the complete information about the task: name, description, completion date
- All HTML in views should have semantic relevance
- Add some basic styles to your application

## Wave 2
In this wave we will add the first set of user interactivity and persistence.

- Create a new task:
  - The home page should contain a link to Add a new task. This will give the user a form to fill out with the appropriate task fields.
  - After the new task is added, the site should take the user back to the home page which displays the full list of tasks. The new task that was just added should be included in the full list of tasks.
- Delete an existing task:
  - On the home page, add a button or link for each task that will, once clicked:
    1. Ask the user to confirm that they definitely want to delete the task.
    1. Delete the task from the database and redirect the user back to the list of remaining tasks

## Wave 3
In this wave we will extend the interactivity with users, allowing them to edit existing tasks in a couple of different ways. Follow _RESTful_ conventions when implementing these features.

- Edit a task:
  - Add an `edit` action that renders a form allowing the user to update all the fields of a task.
  - Submitting the form from the `edit` action should _update_ the existing task; not create a new one.
  - Link to the `edit` action from the task's `show` page, using a link of some sort.
  - DRY up your code by reusing the view code from the `new` functionality
    - Hint: Rendering _partials_ in Rails.
- Mark a task complete:
  - Add a button to the list of tasks on the home page that, when clicked, will mark a task complete.
  - Update the database with the task's completed date

## Final Wave!
In this wave, we explore creating ActiveRecord associations by creating `belongs_to` and `has_many` relationships.

- Create a model & migration for a new Person object.
  - at a minimum, a Person should have a name
- Create seed data to add at least three Person records to the database.
- Each Task in your database can be assigned to a Person, indicating that Person is responsible for completing the Task.
  - Express the relationship between Person and Task using `belongs_to` and `has_many`
  - Update your Task `index` and `show` actions to include displaying the Person's name to which the Task belongs.
  - Update your Task's `new` and `edit` actions to allow for selecting an _existing_ Person to which the Task should be associated.
- Add a new people (the plural of Person) controller with the following routes and actions
  - `index` action: Show a list of all people in the database.
    - Link each Person's name to their `show` action.
    - The index should include a count of how many _uncompleted_ tasks are assigned to each Person.
  - `show` action: show all of the Person's information
- Create a custom route and action for showing a complete list of a Person's tasks, both complete and incomplete.
  - The url of this page should look something like `http://localhost:5000/people/1/tasks`.
  - Link to this action from a Person's `show` view.
- Deploy your completed app to Heroku.
